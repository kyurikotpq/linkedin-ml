Before starting — I'm hosting a free workshop about this TODAY, March 8th at 4pm EST. I'll drop a registration link below, and yes there will be a replay if you see this late or can't make it live.

First = Positioning 🎯  An ideal customer is made up of 3 pillars.

☝️ Your ideal customer has a problem, that you can solve
😕 —This is called the core problem—
✌️ Your ideal customer is aware of this problem
❤️ They have the means & desire to solve this problem

Second = Delivery 👨‍🏫 Use the 1-3-3-1 Method in a live workshop format.

🏅 1 Clear Outcome for Customers
🎯 3 Steps to Achieve the Outcome
✅ 3 Lessons to Complete Each Step
👨‍🏫 1 Q&A to Implement Lessons

Third = Marketing or Sales? 💰

🗣️ Basically, if you have an audience = Marketing
💵 If you don't have an audience = Sales

Get used to sales. If you have the right positioning, the right offer will resonate with your ideal customer. Either way, positioning helps immensely.

Fourth = Launch 🚀 Create your workshop & charge $97 → Sell to 10 people ~ $1,000 revenue.

You might have to host it twice & make $500 each.

You will learn from each iteration! What did people like? What was meh? Build on it. Offer 1-1 coaching to people who fit.

Fifth (Bonus)! = Scale 📈

After all of that, keep going! Maybe it's a different offer, but hopefully you build on the workshop.

Take the replay & edit to a course offer. The 1-3-3-1 Method works here too. Add lessons as you learn from the live sessions.

Here are the 3 most common problems and how to fix each one.

Problem: Generic CTA → Fix: Specific Problem/Outcome
This is far and away the most common—but thankfully—easiest to fix. If your CTA is ""sign up for tips and tactics"", you're not telling anyone anything.

Problem: Promise vs Proof → Fix: Actually Publish
I see it all the time. ""New issues every week"" but on the recent issues... you haven't published in 3 months. If that's what you promise, don't blatantly show me something contrary.

Problem: Distracting from the CTA → Fix: Highlight the CTA
An email list is one of your most valuable assets. Put it front and center with a specific, proven outcome to use as CTA.

2. Don't promise what you can't prove

"Make your customer the hero of the story 🦸‍♀ 🦸‍♂️
This is the first piece of advice I give clients when we're writing their sales copy.

Reading that statement will sound obvious in theory, but in practice most creators struggle to make their customer the hero.

It's not because you're self-absorbed, it's because you're insecure.

Before you leave in huff — let me explain...

Most websites and sales pages talk a lot about how great the product is, awards won, accolades received, and how brilliant and life-changing the offer could be.

This is insecure copywriting. You're desperate to prove how smart, successful, and worthy you and your ideas are — so you use the most important part of the page to show the prospect why they should trust you.

Don't be insecure, be a guide 🧙‍♂️

The prospect is on your page because they have a problem and think you can help. If your page doesn't tell the prospect how to solve the problem—and fast—they'll find someone else who will.

The secret? It's all in the shift.

"I don’t believe in work-life balance.

The stories sparked by societal pressures craft the narrative that there’s a right or wrong way to live our lives. This puts pressure that our lives should be equally split between work and personal. For many, we are wasting energy striving towards an ideal that is near impossible to achieve.

Yet, the reality is that some thrive with a work-focused life. Others thrive on having a paycheck to focus elsewhere.

"A high-performing, passionate, and innovative team isn’t nice to have.

It’s a necessity.

Here is how you can drive superior organizational performance 👇🏼

If you’re committed to fostering a culture of innovation, productivity, and employee satisfaction, this is for you.
However, if you're looking for quick fixes or traditional top-down management strategies, this may not align with your leadership style.

Many startups struggle with employee engagement, team cohesion, and fostering innovation. Traditional leadership models fail to address these issues, leading to:

High employee turnover
Low morale
Stagnated growth

Transformational leadership emphasizes:
Inspiration
Individual consideration
Intellectual stimulation

This leads to higher employee satisfaction and increased organizational performance. Companies like Google, Apple, and Tesla have adopted aspects of this leadership style.

Implement transformational leadership involves a four-step process:
1. Inspirational Motivation: Communicate a compelling vision of the future, demonstrating enthusiasm and optimism.
2. Intellectual Stimulation: Encourage creativity and critical thinking, creating an environment where new ideas and innovation are welcomed.
3. Individualized Consideration: Understand and acknowledge each employee's unique needs and abilities, and provide them with opportunities for growth.
4. Idealized Influence: Lead by example, exhibiting high moral and ethical standards.

The ability to adapt and innovate is crucial for any startup. Transformational leadership fosters a culture of creativity and adaptability. This makes it especially relevant and useful in today's dynamic business environment.

Companies that have employed transformational leadership have seen remarkable results.

Google's emphasis on intellectual stimulation has led to groundbreaking products like Google Maps and Gmail.

Tesla's Elon Musk inspires his workforce with a compelling vision of a sustainable future, driving remarkable innovations in electric vehicles and renewable energy.

If you're striving for greater focus and clarity in achieving your goals…

This rule is your secret weapon.

If you're an entrepreneur overwhelmed by the multitude of goals and tasks on your plate, this method is designed for you.

If you're content with juggling countless goals without clear focus or direction, then this might not be the solution you're looking for.

Many struggle with prioritizing their goals and end up spread too thin.

This results in mediocre performance across many tasks instead of excellent performance in a few key areas.

The issue lies in the lack of a clear, focused strategy for goal prioritization.

The 25-5 Rule is famously used by Warren Buffett.

Buffett credits this rule with helping him concentrate on what truly matters for his unprecedented success in the investment world.

Here's how the 25-5 Rule works:

Step 1: Write down your top 25 career goals.
Step 2: Circle the five most important goals. These are your primary focus.
Step 3: The remaining 20 goals that you didn’t circle? These become your 'avoid at all cost' list.

No matter what, these things get no attention from you until you've succeeded with your top five.

It's more important than ever to have a clear focus.

The 25-5 Rule is relevant because it provides a simple, yet powerful framework for cutting through the noise and concentrating on what truly matters for your success.

By adhering to this rule, Warren Buffett has become one of the wealthiest and most respected investors in the world.

His success serves as a powerful case study of the effectiveness of focused goal prioritization.

Take control of your success today.

Apply the 25-5 Rule and become the focused, goal-oriented entrepreneur you aspire to be.

Remember, success is about doing a few things exceptionally well, not doing many things averagely.

"I moved back to SF. My story, why it's relevant for folks building in AI, and why I'm back 🌁 👇🏼

I'm originally from Chicago.

Yet, I was fascinated with the Bay Area from a young age. The intersection of beauty in nature and creativity in technical innovation is unparallel to just about anywhere in the world.

I first moved to SF in 2016 to work at . I led UX for one of their first AI products, which I released at a Dreamforce keynote.

After working at Salesforce for a few years, I joined to work on Maps and Search. I learned how to build at a more massive scale for 2B+ MAU.

Then, covid hit. The city started to change. People were fleeing. Remote work was the norm. I always wanted to live nomadically, so this was the perfect opportunity.

I moved out of SF, quit Google, and focused on my previous startup (Design To Be) full-time, all while traveling the world. After a year of working and traveling, I was itching for roots again.

I'd always been curious about LA. So, I decided to give it a try.

I love LA. The startup ecosystem is abundant and ever-growing – especially for folks building in the CPG, creator, and wellness ecosystems. And the lifestyle is incredible 🌴

What's become evident is that getting off the ground is my top priority. This clarity led to 7+ mo of sobriety, daily movement and meditation, a shift in the types of people I connect with, etc. (tldr a refinement in how I invest my time)

After insane AI advancements in March, I had the pull to be in SF for most of April. SF has proven to be the epicenter of AI, especially with Sam Altman and other AI leaders who have spoken out against remote work.  So, top AI talent and innovators are here.



While in SF in April, I experienced more serendipity and flow than I've yet to experience. Progress in what I was building was taking new speed. And as much as connections can be made online, genuine relationships are built in person.

Upon returning to LA after my time in SF, I knew I needed to move back to get off the ground. What’s been wild about life lately is that upon devoting more of my energy to my purpose, that’s much greater than me, big decisions have become crystal clear.

I'm super excited to be back in the bay area. If you're based in the bay and are a founder or investor in AI, I'd love to chat. Send me a DM/comment on this post, and let's grab coffee ☺️

A place for 40+ complete strangers to meet & get to know each other.

Each hangout ends up running for 4+ hours (with separate gatherings being held outside of these official hangouts!).

4 hours is a shocking amount of time, but it's also unsurprising because these gatherings attract strangers with similar values and interests, i.e. People who:

✅ Are thinking of / in the process of / have quit their job

✅ Know that there is more to life than this (+ are actively looking to do/give back more)

✅ Are ambitious / Want to step outside their comfort zone (even if they're very happy with their current job)

I intend for this podcast to be an open platform where I scratch my own itch for knowledge and share the invaluable lessons I've learned along the way. It's a space where we can learn and grow together, inspired by countless stories.

My hope is for you to find something interesting and fascinating for yourself as I try to satisfy my own curiosity and have some fun.
See you there!

"Wanna make new friends together? 🤫

Issue: The older we get, the harder it is to make / maintain relationships.

It’s also hard to do it alone.

So here’s what I propose: Every week, we will have participate in a mini-challenge designed to get us out of our comfort zone to network with other people & share the results/experience online (if you’re comfortable).

Why do it?
1️⃣ Just joining this challenge will let you meet new people 
2️⃣ It’s a “public vow” to do this for 5 weeks - a little pressure can be good
3️⃣ You get to reconnect & meet new people!
4️⃣ Be inspired by how other people are executing the challenges 
5️⃣ You'll get content to write on LinkedIn
6️⃣ And tick off a New Year Reso? 😉
7️⃣ Most importantly, have a little fun 🎉

Wanna join?

It’s 100% free.

Just leave a comment below and I’ll add you to the group!

"You don’t have to go viral on LinkedIn to “succeed”.

And the reason is simple:

Virality doesn’t often translate into sales / connections.

It’s pure vanity.

Here’s how I’d think of it instead:

*

When I was an in-house counsel, we’d sometimes look for external counsel to give instructions to.

We Google.

And also use LinkedIn to learn more about each lawyer.

Fact is, most lawyers and law firms don’t write any articles.

But if you’ve written something related to AI language modelling and I have an AI linguistic query, I’m much more likely to reach out to explore working with you.

Because you stand out from the sea of “IP lawyers” who have shown zero interest in the web3 world (that I can see).

This brings me to LinkedIn writing.

And why I strongly believe that we’re moving to a world where most professionals MUST be content creators of some sort.

1️⃣ Large firms are bureaucratic.

You have to be given permission to write.

It takes forever to publish.

And publishing once every two months barely cuts it, given how fast the world is changing.

Not so with a LinkedIn post.

2️⃣ Your personal LinkedIn profile is personal.

You must’ve seen LinkedIn company pages.

LinkedIn itself barely gives those an algo boost.

A post I write on my personal profile can get 4000 views and 10 views on the STIMY company page.

Moreover with your profile, you can showcase your personality.

And that helps you stand out even more.

If you think about it, everything is just storytelling.

Know why you’re writing, and adapt your story to suit your needs.

If you’ve gone to a conference, you don’t have to just say “so privileged to have attended and met these people!”.

I’m sorry but
- everyone says it; and
- I don’t care.

So make me care.

Tell me why I should care.

What excited you about meeting this person?

Because you’ve liaised online for thr longest time and finally met in person, and now you’re launching a virtual arbitration webinar together?

Now that’s interesting. Personal. Professional.

And just might attract other LinkedIn lurkers with the same interests as you.

3️⃣ You’re building your personal brand.

Your posts will always be a part of your profile.

It’s what you’ll be known for no matter what happens: resignation, layoffs, retirement.

And even if your post doesn’t go viral, a future client might find it.

That 1 post might just win you the mandate you want. 😉

*

All this to say - I think many people would benefit from writing more on LinkedIn.

NOT everyone can or need to.

But many more do.

And now is the perfect time, before even more people jump on the platform and drown our voices out!

"4 harsh truths of being an online creator today:

1️⃣ Being an OG is a tremendous power & it’s almost impossible to replicate

2️⃣ What was applicable 10 years ago, is unlikely to be applicable now.

Even things that applied a year ago, probably won’t.

Remember the time when everyone used 30 hashtags on every IG post?

Then started posting reels?

And now repurpose their Tik Tok videos for use on the platform?

Recently, Adam Mosseri announced that Instagram has gone too deep into video and are going back to just photos. Not even carousel. 🤷🏻‍♀️

3️⃣ Competition

The beauty of working online is that almost everything can be reverse engineered.

If you can do it, so can everyone else.

And the more people join, the greater the competition.

4️⃣ Locality matters

Yes, the Internet helps level the playing field.

But it still plays a significant role.

People are still influenced by the thought that “you’re in Malaysia, so you should be cheaper”.

Or just want someone they can hire or interact with in their own time zone.

Then there are the platforms themselves: Tik Tok shows & promotes content depending on where you are. If you want to attract a European audience, then you need to be in Europe.

Not Malaysia.

The algorithm won’t showcase your content otherwise.

The life of a content creator is a lot harder than it seems. 😅

"Size does matter. 🤫


But NOT so much when you're building your personal brand.

Some of the financial advisors I've seen got their focus all wrong.

They'd follow top creators and mirror them.

All their strategies and postings.

Here are the problems:

❌ They spend hundreds of hours on ChatGPT and keeping swipes
❌ Even if they grew their followers by hundreds or thousands, they attract people whom they can't do business with (given the business they are in)
❌ Their message focus and quality drastically reduces over time
❌ They've ""earned"" thousands of followers but face huge problems in conversion

They've paid the price.

But the problem - their eyes were on the wrong prize.

Quality >>> size of following.

"""Pain is WEAKNESS leaving your body!!"" 😭

I'll always recall this with heavy rain and mud splattering on my face.


This was circa 2005 when I was in military service as a conscript in Singapore.

We were boys being transformed into men... by older men. It was our usual route march and field camp. And for Singaporean men who have gone through this rite of passage, we know this term too clearly:

""Tekan"" - and we add a prefix - ""kena"" - which means get treated harshly or tortured. (kena tekan)

And how we relate to pain (of all sorts) - detach, numb ourselves, and don't feel it... let those sensations of weakness be purged out of your body! (bellowed my Sergeant-Major)

Somehow along the way and especially in Asia, men are taught to handle the big and small ""pains"" the rest of our lives... this EXACT way too.

In psychology, we call these ""coping mechanisms"" - strategies we use in face of trauma and stress to manage painful or difficult emotions.

Common emotional coping mechanisms for men include stonewalling, denial, distraction, humor, substance use, isolation, and rationalization.

April and May are often recognized as the Stress and Mental Awareness months.

And I want to share that I've been seeing a therapist for my mental problems and stresses too.

As a dad to a 2+ year-old toddler, son, husband, leader to an 8-staff company, and accountability coach and speaker to dozens of clients I'm working with.

Here's what I've realized:

🌞 There is no shame in seeing a therapist and especially so as a man. It should be normalized and even, celebrated.

🌞 Therapy has tremendous documented value in terms of improved emotional awareness and regulation, healthier coping mechanisms, increased self-esteem, better relationships, and openness

🌞 In the months I've seen a therapist, I've never been more on top of my business and work. In fact, we've already cleared H2 2022 revenues by Q1 2023. That's ROI for you.

Aside from that, I've also learned to be more in touch with my emotions.

At a recent entrepreneur's retreat, I openly broke down in front of over 20 other peers and shared about my recent challenges at work and home.

Emotions (pain included) don't make us weak. They are our natural ways to read and manage the events in our world. And sometimes, being able to cry and let your emotions out is a cathartic experience that helps in overall regulation.

Recently, I've heard this over a podcast too:

""We go to the gym to get physically stronger. In the same way, we should see a therapist to become emotionally and mentally stronger.""

Fellow men (and women) here on , do you agree? How many of you actively seek your help for your mental and emotional challenges?

"""Ben, I don't like to brag on social media""

I get this a lot as a coach and here's how I help my students overcome this limiting belief.

This pushback usually comes as my students start to build their online brand and presence.

They see the many posts online that go:

- I am extremely proud to announce
- This is my ""biggest win...""
- I am not shy to share that this week...

And then, a surge of self-consciousness hits them. They wonder how is it that it's almost like taking flesh off them... to just talk about themselves?

Sounds familiar?

Here's what I'd ask and tell them usually:

1. What's the premise of social media?

To create media (content) that allows people to socialize with you.

There's nothing wrong with sharing your wins because when you believe you have a tribe of positive and like-minded people, they will want to celebrate with you. Like you will, with them, right?

Maybe take lead to be truly happy for others, first? (related to point #2)

2. What's triggering you?

If you've negative emotions and beliefs about others when they share and celebrate, chances are it's also a sign of what's going on for you, inside.

Could it be that you have a negative relationship with celebrating and acknowledging yourself too? Maybe you've been muted or snubbed when you're younger and you've learned not to talk so much about yourself?

Our childhood traumas and experiences shape us in more ways than one. Look inwards.

3. How can we do better?

Of course, don't just humble brag in all of your posts. People know it fast.

When you share a win or an achievement, try to weave in insights, lessons you've learned, reflective questions, and paradigm shifts. All these will help others to learn while they cheer you on.

Can you also recognize good people who contributed to your success?

"""Ben, how much do you charge?""

This simple question and call changed my life.


I didn't set out to be a speaker.

In fact, my childhood dream was like most boys - to be a pilot and then later, a policeman.

But when I was in Seoul for a student exchange in 2009, I did a Skype call with a volunteer organization.

Back then in my twenties, I had spent the past 3-4 years teaching youths how to public speak.

I didn't think of it any more than... I've conquered my fear on stage so I want to help more people do likewise.

And then on the call, the program leader shared she had a small budget for a program she was running. And she wanted to invite me to deliver a segment:

""Ben, how much do you charge?""

My mind was blank.

I was in disbelief: ""you mean, I CAN charge?""

What happened next was my first paid assignment and over a decade later, I speak and coach for a living across 15+ cities and 3 continents.

If there's something I've learned - celebrate your value.

And more so, work at identifying and mastering what it takes to create that deep value for people whom you like to serve.

Every day, work at becoming better at your craft. So you'll become too good to be ignored (so says Cal Newport)

One of the best ways to create and convert trust with your followers can be explained from the Trust Equation.

It's a framework taught by Charles Green in the book, The Trusted Advisor.

Here's the equation:

𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 (𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘀𝗮𝘆)
↳ Educate your clients on problems, trends, opportunities, and key recommendations and enhance how you communicate in writing or speech

𝗥𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 (𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗱𝗲𝗹𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆, 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗹𝘆)
↳ Share your track record and wins, clients you serve, case studies of your Ideal Client Profile (ICP) while staying in one lane

𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗮𝗰𝘆 (𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗰𝗹𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘀𝗮𝗳𝗲𝘁𝘆)
↳ Document stories and moments that reveal your real self – disappointment, rejections, share your inner world (thoughts and emotions) AND in relation to how it value adds to your practice

𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗳-𝗢𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 (𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗳𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗼𝗻 𝗺𝘆 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘁𝘀 𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀)
↳ Talk about the clients you serve, your decision-making processes, and how you act in your clients’ interests. 80% of your content should be centered on your clients and 20% about yourself

It was a long-overdue catch-up with !

I've known Anna for some time as alumni of .

Particularly how she ventured out of a cushy banking job to champion financial literacy for women and then now, scaling food holdings and investments.

Mrs Pho, Tsuta, Burgs Burgers are part of their portfolio brands!

As we walked, I took away some interesting insights that I thought you may appreciate:

🍔 On hiring and developing good people - sometimes our best hires are often people who may not look the most ""polished"" but have hunger, raw potential, and focus.

So don't be all blown away by ""showmanship"" and ""presence""... we have to look deeper.

Yes, the ability to communicate and sell yourself is important.

But even more so are a passion for the work, desire to grow and contribute, and deep fit with our work requirements and culture.

🍔 On being challenged - Anna shared that one of the drives and motivations for her in scaling her ventures was about... being challenged.

After previously interviewing 12 CXO personalities for my first book, this was deja vu.

Entrepreneurs and high-performing corporate leaders bring their A-game when faced with adversities, huge ""forest fires"" and emergencies (well, of course, that shouldn't be a permanent state of affairs!)

It's the mettle, calmness, and clarity of mind, pushing through with a strategy toward a resolution that matter.

🍔 On staying curious and effective - as we enjoyed coffee after our walk, Anna whipped out her phone and I knew it.

It was her walking app but not any usual one!

In fact, it's a Web 3.0 lifestyle app for walkers and runners with Social-fi and Game-fi elements.

This has been of the highlights for my week - being a guest lecturer for the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Generation Leaders Program, representing more than 25,000 members from over 160 countries.

And what business have I to be in front over 25 astute and talented doctors?

As one of the 2 residency guest lecturers, I taught them insights on communications:

🎙️The power of intention and how it guides your being and identity as a communicator and hence, your spoken communications

🎙️The true spirit of communicating from Hard Talk to Heart Talk — what does it take to speak such that people feel heard and felt

“So that’s why I want to be their source of hope and strength”

"""The speaker (Benjamin Loh) was a waste of our time""

These words stung me so badly.


It was one of my first professional presentations delivered in professional Mandarin in Macau.

Although I have been paid to speak professionally for 6-7 years at that point, it was my first professional Mandarin language presentation.

Long story short, I bombed. I was in complete disarray, couldn't engage my audience and fumbled through.

It was painful to watch.

En route back to my hotel room in a lift full of warm bodies, I squirmed myself in one corner towards the back so I could avoid eye contact with anyone else.

But I could listen in to the chatters and one of them scoffed:

""The main hall speaker, Benjamin Loh, was terrible. He was a waste of our time""

Little did she know that the speaker was also in the lift.

That day, I cooped myself up in the room for the next 10 hours.

A part of me wanted to give up on this speaking thing. I felt as if my esteem and identity suffered a massive trainwreck, head-on.

Thankfully, I recalled what my first mentor shared with me on the Identity / Role concept.

🌟 Roles are what we do in our lives, professional and personal. It's how we go about playing the different functions in life - like father, son, sister, business owner, staff etc.

💎 Identity is who we are when we strip ourselves of all the roles we play. It's our self-identity and image, built upon our beliefs of ourselves.

What was relevant here was how it's important to detach your identity from your role, especially when things don't go your way.

I calmly reflected and reviewed all that went wrong in my 'Role' column as a speaker - getting ahead of myself, overloading my work schedule, not pacing myself well, needing to internalize the language well.

And then, I told myself how I can raise my Role score from a 2/10 (self-assessed) to a higher score next.

Next, I wrote down what I can acknowledge myself in the 'Identity' column as a human being.

I went through some breaking moments as a serial bully victim, grew more resilient and intentional, and did things that my peers wouldn't or couldn't. I reviewed my iPhone folder of compliments, long letters from people whom I've inspired, photos of my loved ones and late grandma who made me believe in myself.

My Identity score was gradually restored to 8/10.

After those hours of isolation, I walked out and gave a light pat on my shoulder. I continued walking on again.

--

The truth is we are often celebrated (or dissed) because of the roles we play. Yet, we seldom acknowledge or honor the identities behind those roles - the real ""you"" and ""I"".

Remember - you are not made any lesser because of the""failures"" and setbacks in your roles. (quote the recent layoffs, if you're affected)

""Ben, I'm sorry to tell you this. But I want to pursue my dream to fly."" ✈️


I won't deny it... I was disappointed too.

Because this staff of mine has been my star hire as a social media project manager. I hired her as a graduate hire under the SGUnited program by in 2021.

And if you think of every negative trait the media paints out of Gen-Zs... she bucks them all.

😫 LAZY? She was the hardest worker in my room. Chasing her boss and manager (me) when I'm behind my deliverables.

😫 SELF-ENTITLED? She was thoughtful, mature, and considerate - often getting things done without prompting and knowing me well.

😫 IMMATURE? When I first met her, she already had clear life plans on settling down, getting a property of her own, and starting her own business... at 22 years old!

To me, age has never been an indication of maturity and character. So I learned not to tar an entire generation with broad strokes!

I also had plans to promote her the second time, raised her pay again, and put her in charge of some stretch projects and into the Philippines where I had 3 other staff members.

At the start of our year, I facilitated a career planning conversation and I sent her back to think hard about what she wanted for her career with us this year.

She then reconnected with her dream to fly for which was halted because of the pandemic.

I told her in no confusing terms - ""Go for it. You have my blessings and I will do all I can to support you and your dreams"" 💯

Whether it's to bridge her to my friends who flew with airlines, coach her for interviews or even professionally produce her self-introduction video.

Why do I do so?

Because this is what I'd hope for if I were her. And also I believe that your 20s should be the best time to explore, take risks, and pursue unconventional paths... exactly what I did during mine too.

And also for the practical consideration that flying with an airlines has a ""youth premium"" (or age penalty) so I didn't want her to have any regrets even though I could hold her back with higher pay and better packages.

I may still be struggling to be a good leader and manager in growing my company.

But I've learned also that the best leaders are not just drivers of business and performance. But also, stewards of lives and dreams.

"""Ben, you need to learn to let your guard down""

And the ""business advice"" I probably needed most.

Thankful to have spent the past 3.5 days on a leadership retreat organized by the / EO Accelerator in beautiful Yogyakarta, Indonesia.

Being a professional speaker, I'm used to being in front of an audience, on stages and with instruction.

But I totally ""trusted the process"" and surrendered to the trusted care of:

- Dean of the EO Academy and having built and sold 3 businesses in Malaysia previously

- led and was part of the world's first female team to climb Mount Everest and the highest mountain in each continent, public speaker and stand-up comedian

- leadership coach, Enneagram facilitator, healer and guide. A corporate thriver turned soul and spiritual teacher

The past weekend saw me undergo an inner journey where I took home some of these poignant takeaways:

🎁 The bigger the mountain you have to climb, the bigger the base you've got to have -- about building the capacity, aptitude, competencies and stamina to thrive under tough times

🎁 Clarity of vision and focus of intent -- it's not just about sheer drive or brute force. But it's about aligning your business with your values, purpose of existence, meaning-making, interests, and growth of your staff and more

🎁 We are infinitely dynamic and shouldn't be a ""prisoner of our type"" -- we needn't be constricted or limited by our behavioral or personality types. That life always presents us the opportunities to grow beautifully and in ways that we'll be surprised too.

Particularly, I found the ""keys"" to being an open and freer person.

"The Transformative Power of a Reading Habit:

We've all heard that reading is fundamental. But in our busy modern lives, setting aside time to read every day can seem like an impossible task.

However, the benefits of consistent reading are immense.

Reading keeps our brains active and engaged. It exposes us to new ideas, perspectives, and information. Reading builds empathy, enhances our emotional intelligence, and sparks creativity.

Will reading one book suddenly change your life? Probably not.

The impact of reading happens slowly, through consistent habit. As entrepreneur Jim Rohn famously said, “Don’t wish it were easier, wish you were better.” The same applies to reading.

By carving out just 30 minutes a day to read, you set yourself up for compound growth.

Those small snippets of reading time accumulate into a reservoir of knowledge. After a year of daily reading, you’ll look back amazed at how much you’ve learned and how your thinking has expanded.

Here are 3 key benefits of a daily reading habit:

1) Expanded Knowledge Base

The more we read, the more we know. Reading exposes us to information we wouldn’t otherwise encounter in our normal routines. It introduces new concepts, facts, histories, and frameworks. With a broader knowledge base, we’re able to connect more dots, share more interesting ideas in conversations, and bring more diverse perspectives to solving problems.

2) Enhanced Critical Thinking

Reading exercises our brains’ critical thinking capacities. As we read, we’re constantly analyzing the author’s argument, evaluating claims, and drawing our own conclusions. These skills allow us to cut through noise, assess information intelligently, and reason through complex issues. With sharpened critical thinking abilities, we’re better positioned to succeed in our careers and make wise decisions in our personal lives.

3) Increased Creativity

When we read, we step into new imaginary worlds and explore different modes of thinking. These experiences stretch our perspectives and inspire us to be more innovative in our own work. Studies have shown fiction readers score higher on tests of empathy, social perception, and creativity. Reading literary fiction actually changes the physical structure of our brains to make us more creative.

While no single book will suddenly alter your life, the compound effects of daily reading can be transformative over time. The 30 minutes you invest in reading today will pay intellectual dividends for years to come.

"The secret to conversational copywriting:

Volume.

End of answer - see you around.

* * *

Just kidding, 𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘥𝘢.

I used to write like most people.

Boring. Robotic. Academic.

We can blame our teachers for that. Zombie writing was OK for school, but it ain’t for the internet.

Why?

Because we’re in a battle for attention against platforms like Netflix and TikTok.

𝗜𝗳 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝗿𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱, 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝗿𝗲 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗴𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱.

𝟭. 𝗦𝘁𝘂𝗱𝘆 𝗲𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝗽𝘆𝘄𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀

Email is the mecca for conversational copy. I use my inbox like most people use social. It’s rammed full of content.

The aim is sheer exposure.

I’ve left a link to some of my favourites in the comment below.

𝟮. 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗰𝗼𝗽𝘆

Writing is like learning an instrument.

The best way to learn isn’t to write your own songs. You want a feel for what it’s like to be great at the craft.

So every morning, I do ‘copywork’ for 20 minutes.

I’ll take my favourite writers (currently Andre Chaperon and Ian Stanley) and write their stuff out word for word.

It’s slow, boring, and bloody effective.

𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸

The usual advice is to read your writing out loud and edit what doesn’t sound natural.

I do the opposite.

I speak while I write. I’ll grin and chuckle to give my writing a light-hearted feel.

Of course, people will think you’re a weirdo if you write in public.

You may get kicked out of a few cafés.

My wife was 8 months pregnant, and we were moving to a new city.

Soon I had no sleep, no income, and no idea what to do but this…

As I embarked on one of the most challenging transitions of my life,

I did the one thing I knew how to do in this type of situation.

The only thing when panicked with no answers:

STOP.

BREATHE.

REFLECT.

Take a deep breath and reflect on all my past experiences.

Not the good ones but the bad ones.

Like getting fired with nothing.

Like losing everything when your home and business went up in (actual) flames.

Like going broke and having to live out of your truck.

Like staying my own boss year after year despite every setback.

The ones I had always persevered through in the past.

The ones that always came to pass.

The ones that always led to enlightenment and new opportunities.

The ones that had all brought me here.

To a beautiful adoring wife and child in a new city we love.

And to an even bigger opportunity.

An opportunity to win or lose.

An opportunity to either implode into a world of anxiety and worry.

And lose the pleasure of this precious time with my baby girl,

Or an opportunity to have faith in my resilience.

Enjoy this magical and equally fleeting moment with my family.

Despite any negative circumstances.

Despite the fear of this new unknown.

This was an opportunity to believe in myself.

To know I will make it through.

To know that if I need to, I will redefine, pivot and adapt.

To know with full presence that if I just stop, breathe, and reflect,

I’ll find the answers and the solace within.

And so, with all I could possibly muster, I did.

And little by little, day by day, I persevered.

But sometimes you have to talk about the bad things that will happen if they don't buy your product. People make decisions based on motivation. Not logic. And pain is a hell of a motivator.



Two ways to do this:

1) Write down your customer's frustrations. As many as you can.

The key here is that you have to use words they've used themselves. They hit harder. It's the difference between saying ""you want to lose a couple pounds"" and ""you've been hitting the gym for 6 months and your wife can't tell the difference.""



2) Imagine those frustrations play out over 10 years. What would their future look like?

Those are your customer's fears. And they think about them daily. They also hit hard. It's the difference between ""you'll be low energy"" and ""you won't be able to play with your kids because you'll be too busy taking a nap.""

I'm not saying focus on negative content. I'm saying that pain can be useful. Just don't overdo it.

It might be me. But I lost a lot of sleep because of it.

I tested out so many offers.

So many growth tactics.

Listened to so many people's advice that sometimes I couldn't even hear myself.

What's scary is that at some point you realize your followers will lose faith in you.

Which is why so many coaches end up stuck.

Or broke.

Their audience sees them try so many things.

And they end up looking like an amateur.

So people don't buy.

The bad news are that one day it might be too late.

The good news are that it's 100% preventable.

He had 25,000 followers and felt like his audience lost trust in him.

A few months later, he made $10,000.

The trope about kids these days is that they’re coddled.

They get participation trophies. They’re shielded from criticism. They’re overly connected to their feelings from years of therapy.

That couldn’t be further from the truth. Particularly for “youth in high achieving schools.” (Not my definition.)

The data is particularly jarring for this group of kids. Their parents make good money and are well educated. They live in affluent neighborhoods with good schools. These families represent the top 20% of US households, beginning at $130,000 of annual income. At these schools, the students on average test in the top 25% of all US students.

(Said differently, their parents are RadReaders.)

Now you may be thinking that we’re talking about the elite private schools in NYC (𝘈𝘷𝘦𝘯𝘶𝘦𝘴) or LA (𝘏𝘢𝘳𝘷𝘢𝘳𝘥 𝘞𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘭𝘢𝘬𝘦). But the data captures students in public and private schools in just about every state in the US ranging from Maine to New Mexico.

The bad news for these youth in “high-achieving schools?”

They are considered an “at risk group.”

This is according to a 2019 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.

Right alongside other “at risk groups” including:

Kids living in poverty and foster care.

Kids whose parents just immigrated to the US.

And wait for it:

Kids with incarcerated parents.

You read that correctly. Your neighbor’s kid who’s trying to get a rowing scholarship at Dartmouth is statistically as likely to suffer from clinical anxiety, depression and prone to substance abuse as a child with parents in jail.

"I got a million-dollar question answered for you:

Is an economic downturn a good playfield to give it a shot at entrepreneurship?

Here are three powerful takeaways I got from when I asked whether ""the eye of the storm"" was a good time to start a service-based business during his ""How to 'CEO' during an economic meltdown"" session yesterday. 👇

✅ Understanding that when ""things shift,"" there's a lot of opportunity.

A recession is fundamentally where many rules get rewritten, what worked before simply doesn't anymore, and we're forced to examine different ways of doing things.

✅ The opportunity cost of starting a business might be more favorable in a recession.

From an ""incentive"" perspective, I ask myself — if we are amid a downturn, does that mean there are only way is ""up""?

What if you could start something, E.g., a digital product, a course, or a coaching business, for less than what it would cost when the economy is booming?

If we understand things are ""shifting,"" we know there is indeed the possibility of ""that lower price"" to do something.

✅ Identify whether a recession increases or decreases your safety net.

""How much can you de-risk?"" Khe said — these words floated in my head for a minute as I thought about all the current variables in my life. Having so many things at stake is the norm nowadays, and thus, the need for steady income, health insurance, basic needs, etc.

Doing your business full-time when it makes no money = A LOT of risks.

At least for me, since I already have a 9-5 (and to be respectful of my employer's time), I could take client calls in the evenings, work on my ideas on the weekends, and schedule my interactions on social media.

Ultimately, it's all a balancing act, and no one is more suited to ascertain how to play around with it than yourself.

"Next month I’m doing something crazy.

I’m going to a bachelor party.

In Munich. For 3 nights.

It’s a 12-hour flight from LAX.

But here’s the crazy thing.

I don’t drink beer.

And my cheap ass wouldn’t spend the extra $700 on Premium Economy.

So instead I have a middle seat. For a red eye.

𝗢𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝟯 𝗱𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿
A friend of mine (who’s a wealth manager) has a rule of thumb for his clients.

𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘰𝘯𝘭𝘺 𝟥 𝘥𝘪𝘨𝘪𝘵𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘯𝘦𝘵 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘵𝘩 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘮𝘢𝘵𝘵𝘦𝘳 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘭𝘦𝘧𝘵 𝟥.

So if you have $463,218 — you’re not thinking of the $218.

And if you have $3,649,855 — the $9,855 doesn’t move the needle.

Which means you can spend anything to the right (i.e. up to $999 and $9,999, respectively) without thinking.

His rationale: Since you don’t think about them conceptually, they don’t matter in real life.

(Note, there are probably edge cases to consider.)

Now my ticket to Munich cost $1,800. An additional $700 would bought me a lot of comfort.

But that’s a 40% premium.

So I didn’t do it. And stuck with my middle seat.

Yet as detailed in my personal balance sheet, my friend’s rule gives me cover for up to $9,999.

Old habits die hard. (Especially when your business ain’t doing too well.)

And while we’re months away from the bachelor party, I’m quietly dreading the flight.

𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗴𝗼?
I recently learned that human beings have 80,000 thoughts per day.

Obviously we have to breathe, eat, move around and work. But all that living can’t consume all 80,000 thoughts.

𝘞𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘢𝘵𝘵𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘨𝘰𝘦𝘴, 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘳𝘨𝘺 𝘧𝘭𝘰𝘸𝘴.

I heard this mantra during a recent guided meditation.

I quickly compiled a pie chart of where my attention goes.

Yup, I think a lot about money. I worry. It’s a proxy for ambition, status and self-worth.

It’s why I’m constantly fretting about this flight to Munich.

And over the years, my attention has bounced around. But generally it has flowed into:

How much money did I make?
How much money can I make?
How can I make my business grow?
Am I working enough?
Am I learning enough?
Will I live a long and happy life?
How many followers do I have? (Yes, I do think about this more than I’d like to admit)

And if I’m truly honest, there’s a lot of “me, me, me” on this list. And while I do think about being a great dad and husband, it’s usually after I’ve thought about things on the above list.

The answer depends on your unique situation.

Personally, I keep both, work and private notes, in Evernote. All notebooks related to work start with ""FL"" (Forte Labs) so I can easily distinguish them.

"Have you ever thought of the expense of learning something new in your work or within your team?

As I observed during my time at a boutique French innovation consulting firm in San Francisco, the business model of consulting, for example, revolves highly around the expense of learning something new.

For instance, if we were consulting on self-driving cars, we'd invest significantly in research, understanding, and testing.

The acquisition of such expertise is costly.

However, once we acquired that knowledge for one client, we could repurpose and sell it multiple times.

To run a profitable business, it's vital to spread this research and development cost across many clients.

The challenge is, as an individual or as a team, how do you preserve that expertise in a way that's easily accessible without losing any details or specific data points?

Most people don't realize the power and profitability of thinking once, capturing the essence of that thought, and having it ready to capitalize on it repeatedly.

"11 leads from 1 thread?

“Dude I need to get some leads”

This is what my first-ever Twitter follower (and my first client) said to me 4 months ago.

He was ready to burst open his wallet without hesitation.

But this wasn’t our first interaction together.

13 months ago, I started building my audience and hit him up about how to grow online.

Did he respond?

Nope.

I got ghosted.

Then there was radio silence for 9 months.

It sucked lol.

Turns out he waved the white flag and logged out of Twitter – accepting slow growth defeat like most creators do.

But after his business leads went dry. He logged back into Twitter to get traffic.

And he saw my hypergrowth.

He fired straight back into my DMs, asking for help.

Of course, I accepted.

He needed new leads for his coaching biz.

The contract was signed.

We got to work.

I taught him my untapped methods for crafting story-telling threads that don’t just demand hordes of attention online…

But land great clients too.

And what happened when he wrote his very first thread using my secret sauce?

He had 11 hot messages blast in his DMs for 1-on-1 coaching.

11 leads from just 1 story-driven thread.

And at just 500 followers, his business began to take off like a rocket.

There are 2 lessons from this.

No.1 - authority is one of the best assets you can have online.

Because he saw me hit 20k+ followers fast, he instantly perceived me as an expert.

And there's no way would I be getting ghosted twice.

You see, when you start creating engaging content that resonates, getting to expert status can happen a lot faster than you think.

Second lesson?

Story-driven tweets have so much power… they can change your online business almost overnight.

If 1 thread can get 11 leads… imagine what a year’s worth of threads could deliver?

Limitless potential.

But in 15 hours the Story System's price is going up.

Need I say more?

Let's dive in:

1.) The Setup

""Show bad qualities that your product fixes""

This is where your hero was before your service/product.

Show:
•The before picture
•How the hero was sad
•The situation's effect on life
•The hero is afraid of change.

Make the reader feel sorry for the hero.

2.) The Crisis

This is the boiling point for your hero. Here's a breakdown:

Wakeup Call:
What problem were they tolerating?

Goal:
Show a change in direction

Uncertainty:
Show how to move through new things

Commitment:
The moment they bought your product

Crisis=Attention

3.) Pursuit

This is the moment your hero uses your product/service

Take the reader through the challenges.

•Actions
•Feelings
•Obstacles
•Experiences

Show setbacks

Then show how your product fixes setbacks.

Create a movie and let the hero get closer to a big win

4.) Conflict

Show the hard parts of the process

•Failures
•Mistakes
•Concerns
•Criticisms

Write about the moment the hero wanted to quit.

Most people fail at stirring emotions.

Remember:

Most advertisements are too good to be true.

Showing hardship creates trust.

5.) Climax

Show when the hero accomplishes their goal:
•What happened?
•Who were they with?
•How did others react?

This makes readers relate to the hero.

Use sensory details:
•See
•Smell
•Taste
•Touch
•Sound

The more vivid the detail, the higher chance of a purchase.

6.) Aftermath

"I struggled for 3 months to get 100 followers online.

Until I found a powerful trick that every author uses.

Here’s the secret trick to help you go mega viral (without months of failure).

Imagine this:

Your neighbor, the crazy one, builds a freaking jetpack.

For real - an actual rocket-blasting-flame-throwing-shooting-you-in-sky jetpack.

And you (with the curiosity of a cat) visit and ask to borrow a rake.

Until your eyes set upon this holy marvel.

So instead of asking to borrow the rake, you ask to borrow the jetpack.

Your neighbor:

-Shrugs his shoulders.
-Looks you deep in the eyes.
-And scratches the dandruff off his white beard.

“Sure” - he says.

Your brilliant neighbor (and unusually trustworthy) hands over that bad boy - the ol’ jetpack.

You shoot across town like a one-man airshow.

You attract attention like a magnet attracts metal.

Then you save a kitten stuck in a tree.

You’re hailed as a freaking superhero.

The best part?

You got all the fame and fun from something your neighbor built!

I know what you’re thinking…

Stealing other people’s stuff is bad right? Wrong!

It’s called borrowed credibility.

Authors do it all the time (you won’t get arrested, I promise).

Borrowing credibility is the easiest way to get attention online.

And there’s another secret benefit…

What is it?

It’s called authority by association.

And this is where I make the confession.

I stole Tim Ferriss’s credibility.

And went mega-viral (see the image below)

To be frank, I stole his freaking jetpack and flew all around Twitter.

Here’s the deal.

Writing stories about other people give you a serious boost (like a jetpack).

Here’s how to gain 1000s of followers by borrowing credibility.

1.) Find your favorite writers, entrepreneurs, fitness gurus, ballerinas, etc…

2.) Study them (like your life depends on it)

3.) Take their best lessons

4.) Write a story about them.

Then share it on Twitter & LinkedIn.

Steal this template:

The greatest (writer, ballerina, businessman,….) of all time:

(Famous person’s name)

I’ve studied there (books, blogs, podcasts….) for (amount of time).

Here are the best (#) (tips, lessons, tactics) to give you (benefit):

Throw in the famous person’s picture.

The photo will give the thread even more boost (more jetpacks).

Spoiler alert:

You’ll notice that every author borrows credibility from famous people (sorry).

If you can’t beat them, join them.

Start writing stories about your favorite people.

"When it comes to B2B content marketing, repelling people you don’t want to work with is just as important as attracting those you do.

Those that understand this have a backlog of their dream clients. Those that don’t waste hours every week talking to low-quality prospects.

Here are 3 methods we use to make sure we ONLY attract our dream clients:


1) Talking about the right problems

I could have written this post about “The top 10 LinkedIn hooks to get the most likes”.

- I would have got more engagement.
- I would have gained more followers.
- I would have looked really cool.

But the truth is, the only people engaging would be other creators - not our dream clients.

So instead, I write about problems the people I want to reach are facing.


2) Choosing the right platforms

There are 3 places our dream clients hang out:

- LinkedIn
- Twitter
- Email

So that’s exactly where we push content.

If your touchpoints are on the wrong platforms, you'll attract the wrong prospects.


3) Mirroring their way of communication

The truth is, the people we want on our roster (generally speaking) don’t appreciate:

- Constant selfies with 0 value
- Virtue signalling posts
- Me breaking down the importance of a daily walk

They’re very busy people and unfortunately, they just don’t give a sh*t if I go on a walk at lunchtime or not.

So instead, I make sure to communicate in a way they enjoy reading.

1. Right now, only 45% of B2B businesses are on social media. This will change dramatically over the next 5 years.

2. Real marketing knowledge is nearly non-existent in the space.

3. Average marketers are making a lot of money doing basic things in B2B because of this.

4. Those marketing B2B businesses are losing, those marketing B2B people are winning.

5. B2C marketing is currently 5-6 years ahead of B2B.

6. Over the next decade that will change dramatically as B2C marketers transition over.

7. Most B2B marketers are just using B2C tactics but aiming at businesses - this won’t work.

8. No one is talking about account-based marketing (they should be).

9. There is an untapped market of hundreds of thousands of tradespeople who don’t market themselves.

10. Some agencies will make fortunes tapping into that market in the next few years.

11. Businesses are still overlooking retention marketing.

12. Word of mouth has been the most effective B2B marketing tactic for years, but as a digitally native generation grows older, effective online marketing will trump this.

13. LinkedIn is quickly becoming a non-negotiable for anyone in B2B - this trend will continue to rocket as businesses using Facebook realise.

All in all, I think B2B is a pretty exciting place to work within right now. So much potential to be had!

- Choose 1 pivotal moment from it
- Share it with your readers


3) The showcase

"Sh*tty marketers will tell you that marketing is all about making sales.

It’s not.

Marketing is about making sales easy.

Which means convincing people that you can take them from A → B.

So that when they:

- Hit your landing page
- Jump on a sales call
- Receive your email

They’re chomping at the bit to work with you.

An easy way to do just that?

→ Tell a story of how you’ve helped someone in the past

Here’s how I do it in 3 simple steps:

1. Start with a relatable opening

The key is to make people feel like what you’re saying applies to them.

- Call out their weaknesses
- Use relatable problems
- Be specific

2. Transformation story

Then explain how you solved these problems for someone.

- Break it down into steps
- Don’t use jargon
- Go into detail

3. Desirable ending

Then wrap it up by painting a picture of the outcome you gave your client.

- Explain where they’re at now
- Showcase the contrast from the start
- Spell out the importance of that change

If you master this in your marketing I can guarantee you won’t have a lead flow problem ever again.

People just want to know that you can take them from A → B.

The best way to do that is through a story.

"I'm a gay marketer and I hate Pride Month.

Here's why:


1️⃣ It's not about the community

Pride Month for many marketers is an opportunity to show their brands are ""cool""

It has nothing to do with support or even acknowledgement of the challenges the LGBTQ+ community goes through.

An example? Latest drama with Bud Light:

They wanted to hop on the ""queer train"", so they invited a trans woman to promote their products.

And their conservative customers went feral.

The sh!t hit the fan.

So, they immediately backed out, and even changed their CEO.

Guess a little bullying from right-wings was a bit too much.


2️⃣ It's a money heist.

Yes, rainbow gadgets look beautiful.

But when a brand releases rainbow-themed products only for 1 month a year

And then pretends we don't exist for the remaining 11 months

It's not support.

It's a planned marketing campaign adapting the unique culture of a minority.

Not nice.


3️⃣ It's selective

How many times did you see a black trans woman featured in a pride marketing campaign?

Do I need to add anything?


4️⃣ It's trivialized.

Do you know gay people in Poland can't inherit anything after their partners?

Do you know trans people in Poland have to sue their parents to legally change their gender?

Pride isn't about slapping a rainbow onto everything and slaying the day.

It's about fighting against serious discrimination.

Every. F*cking. Day.


5️⃣ It ignites bigger hatred.

And you suddenly see rainbow EVERYWHERE

Probably not.

Content like this gets massive recognition because these topics are simple.

We expect to see content like this here. We want it because:

More growth = More money

And money is exciting.

The caveat:

This works only in this scenario.

If, for example, you own a highly complicated SaaS helping with data security – the same rules don't apply to your content.

You need a unique, tailor-made strategy created by:

• Diving deep into audience research
• Defining your brand's core values
• Identifying your tone of voice

Plus, LOTS of repetition and testing.

"I brought StoryAngled to 6-figures in 8 months. With Inbound Marketing alone.

Here's 1 method that helped me achieve it all:

REPEATABLE CONTENT FUNNEL

I publish 5-6 times a week. Every week, I publish the same stuff. And nobody gets bored.

How?

The format is the same. The content is consistently better each time.

I know, sounds cocky, but it's really not.

I spend 80% of my time creating content. Either for me or for my clients.

I stay close to my target audience by hopping on calls with them and chatting about their pain points – without pushing them to buy anything from me.

This pushes me to think outside the most common ""content creation playbooks.""

To ensure I don't repeat myself and sound like everyone else, I have to reinterpret them. Dissect the common advice and find new angles to look at it.

It's hard work, but the payoff is just 🤩

My point is: You don't have to hustle to build a profitable business.

You don't have to cheat or sell your soul to the algorithms.

You'll need lots of grit, gallons of coffee, and a huge pile of books to learn from.

But it IS possible.

"Are you tired of creating content that doesn't get engagement?

One reason could be that you're not speaking your audience's language. It's time to start using inclusive language.

Inclusive language shows respect to all readers and makes them feel seen and heard. It's not rocket science, but it takes intentional effort.

"Why being kind and authentic should be your main focus in content marketing:

You don’t need to be a marketing genius to create compelling content.

All you need is empathy and honesty.

And that’s how you succeed in content marketing – by building relationships, not just sales.

GDPR is a fundamental system, both for companies and users.

But it comes with its own set of rules you have to follow.

Sadly, global companies like Meta treat those rules as an afterthought while building their apps.

As a result, many incredible creators from the EU won't have access to a new way of connecting with their followers.

While their American friends are already doing it for the past few hours.

Looking through the window while your friends are having so much fun is... not fun 😅

Doing something most marketers consider ""boring"":

Let's be honest for a second:

Creating content can be time-consuming.

Ideation, creation, editing, adding it to your CMS…

It all steals time from your already busy week.

The way out of this?

Content repurposing.

Yes, the activity most marketers consider ""boring.""

It's boring, but it works.

But you have to get smart about it:

1. Write a LinkedIn post about one topic

2. Reuse the same topic as a script for a video/podcast.

3. Expand on your thoughts and write an in-depth blog post.

4. Include your LinkedIn post and the video podcast in the blog post to grab the reader's attention for longer.

This showcases how much you care about this topic and positions you as an expert.

This gives you more time to analyze how well your current content tilt works.

Or grab a drink of choice and spend the Friday evening not writing another thread about ChatGPT.

It feels surreal for us to be nominated for these 3 awards. 🏆🏆🏆

They serve as a reminder of all the valleys and mountains we have gone through, in the last 6 years. Especially during the dark times of Covid-19, when it seemed like there was no light at the end of the tunnel.

It reminds me of this quote:

Be strong in the valleys and
Be faithful in between”

"10 years ago, my ex-boss made me an offer. Hit $1 million in Year 1. And get an all-expenses-paid trip to Manchester. ✈️

Knowing my fiancé (now husband) is a die-hard Man U fan. He sweetened the deal with his highly coveted season tickets! ⚽️🔥

I gave it my all. Didn’t just reach that million-dollar mark. I surpassed it. 🚀

Here's the curveball: my ex-boss didn't hold up his end of the deal.

So, in 2015, we took matters into our own hands and flew to Manchester for a self-funded trip. And settled for a stadium tour as match tickets were a stretch back then.

—

Looking back, it was a blessing in disguise.

I experienced a huge mindset shift.
And set my sights higher, knowing I could reach and exceed the million-dollar mark. 💪🏼

Starting my own business was no longer just a dream. It became my reality.

I was determined to build a recruitment firm distinct from the rest. One where integrity is the cornerstone. And promises aren't empty words, but real commitments.

Tomorrow, we finally fulfill my husband's dream of witnessing Man U live in action. It's taken a decade, and I'm immensely proud of transforming this dream into reality. 🎉

So, to my ex-boss: thank you for that career-defining moment. 🙏

Without it, I wouldn't be the person I am today.

This journey still blows my mind. There’s truly nothing extraordinary about me. Like most founders, I've faced moments of immense fear, worry, and panic.
 
There were countless times when I wanted to throw in the towel. 🚶🏻‍♀️

Breakthroughs often lie just beyond the point where most people quit. Hold on to your vision, let your faith be stronger than your fear. And keep moving forward! 🙌🏻💪🏼

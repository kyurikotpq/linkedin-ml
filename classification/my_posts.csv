"I didn't have:
❌ a traditional oven
❌ a microwave oven
❌ good pan-frying skills

So, I decided to steam my burrito.

❌ But I also don't have a steam rack to keep the burrito out of the water.

My constraints eventually helped me create a solution:
☕ Flip over the ceramic cover for my cup
🍽️ Balance the sides with flipped-over mini utensils

It's not fancy, but I got to enjoy a hot burrito.

Remember: Creativity doesn't have to be grand.

"2012 - 2015:
✍️ Write a few paragraphs
📓 Put my journal away on a shelf
🧠 Forget about it until 3 months later

2015: Started taking journalling seriously to
💭 Visualize my ideal future
📚 Cope with academic stress

I've journalled consistently since then (8 years!)

Here's the beliefs that helped me stay consistent:

1️⃣ Just write one sentence per day

🗑️ Better to ""ruin"" a journal with rubbish thoughts and angry scribbles, than let those thoughts ruin your mind

"After my migraine attack earlier this year, I realized:

You're going to spend the rest of your life with your mind and your body.

Yes, work is important.
Yes, family is important.
Yes, friends are important.

But it's equally important to:
- Make time to rest
- Protect your peace
- Be your own best friend

"Today's Deliberate Experimentation challenge:

💌 Implement an email marketing ""platform"" in Airtable

Inspiration:
(AI Transformation Officer at Mindvalley)


At Day 1 of 's AI Summit, he demonstrated how to:

🔗 link data through their real-world relationships
🤖 generate ideas and plans from linked data using &

(Notion and 100+ other apps can do this too, but Mindvalley's using Airtable)


I was intrigued. I wanted to try it out!

But I was also a no-code and AI noob.

So I decided to work with Airtable's automations first.

Within 3.5 hours, I was able to set up a bare-bones email marketing platform:
✍️ Let people sign up for a list/list segment via Airtable forms
📝 Let subscribers manage their preferences
📤 Schedule emails to send to subscribers

Now that I have some confidence, I'm excited to:
🤖 Integrate AI for content generation
🗺️ Create automated email sequences for my lead magnet
💌 Style my emails better (it's currently bare-bones HTML)

What are you experimenting with today?

"My brain short-circuited when I saw this bowl of acai 😍

The staff paid so much attention to detail:
🔍 The fancy peanut butter swirl
🔍 The chia seeds sprinkled on top of the strawberries
🔍 The clear layout of every ingredient so that I could see them

I was dying to dive in, but I had a meeting to attend.

When I finally started eating, the ingredients were SO fresh...
It blew my mind for the second time.

Setting and achieving goals is like this bowl of acai.

🧐 If you're clearer and more detailed about what you want...
✅ You'll be more excited to work on it.

🥝 If you have higher-quality ""ingredients"" (habits, mindsets, etc.)...
✅ You'll enjoy the journey a lot more.

"At the age of 10, my grades for Mandarin started dropping.

Worried that I would fail, I asked my parents to enroll me in private tuition.

It worked at first.
Then, my grades quickly stagnated.

By the age of 15, I was doing poorer than my 10-year-old self.

I was putting a lot of effort and time toward the subject, but seeing little improvements.

Feeling bad for wasting my parents’ money, I decided to:
❌ Quit private tuition
🔍 Find my areas of weakness
📝 Practice my areas of weakness more—on my own

Within a year, I managed to do well enough at the national examinations with this strategy.

"🔪 10 years ago, I felt like I'd been stabbed.

It was supposed to be a ""normal"" run during PE.

My diaphragm ached, but an imaginary hand was squeezing my heart.


🛏️ Then, I started having chest pain when resting.

Always a sudden squeeze of the heart.
Always lasts for a minute each time.
Always happens every few months.


""You just need more exercise,"" the doctors said.
👍 ""Maybe you're unfit or stressed.""
👍 ""You're under 20 years old. Your heart should be fine.""
👍 ""It doesn't happen frequent enough to warrant a test.""


🔪 10 years later, the stabbings returned when I tried to sleep on my back.

No other heart attack symptoms.
Still lasts for a minute each time.
Still happens infrequently.

All in all, nothing new to me.


But it was ""abnormal"" to my friend.

She urged me to do a scan.

One abnormal scan result led to another.

Then, I found it: I have a small hole in my heart.

Minor birth defect. Nothing fatal.
But big enough to cause some pain.


👉🏻 Remember: Unprovoked pain or bodily changes could hint at something more serious.

✅ Get it checked out.
✅ Don't let anyone gaslight you.

If you listen to your body when it whispers, you won't have to hear it scream.


P.S. I'm curious to hear if anyone's been gaslit medically too. Too young for X, too old for Y, or too rare to have Z 👇🏼

"One truth I learned about ideas after reading 700,000+ words of fanfiction over the summer:

Ideas come from everywhere.

For one author, his 2,000-word fanfiction idea came from a friend who had, in real life, met a good-looking construction worker that was working on a new building in the neighborhood.

Another author chanced upon a video of Dua Lipa's performance on their Twitter feed and was reminded of their favorite couple pairing. In this pairing, one of the characters is feminine and beautiful, while that character's partner is muscular with tattoos. These physical characteristics fit well into the stereotypes of a singer and a bodyguard, so the author went on to write a 5,000-word story about the couple in the Singer + Bodyguard Alternate Universe.

How, then, can you harness this truth to your advantage?

Find an easy way for you to capture fleeting ideas. That's it.

This ""easy way"" could be anything. Personally, I'm using the daily notes function in JourneyOS, the note-taking and task management app I'm currently building with my good friend. It's still in beta, but JourneyOS lets you capture ideas and tasks quickly. It also encourages you to act (more) on what you know by resurfacing existing notes.

But I've also seen people who use the native notes app on their phones, and people who carry around a small notepad and pen wherever they go. Try a few methods and stick to whatever works for you.

"My grandma never went to school, but...


🧑‍🏫 She learned by osmosis.

My grandma spoke Chinese dialects at home:
- Teochew with her maiden family
- Hokkien with my grandpa's family

She also picked up:
🇨🇦 Conversational English while working for Canadian employers
🇲🇾🇨🇳 Conversational Malay and Mandarin from her customers while selling fish

Her ability to learn from her environment helped her later, when...


📈 She sought opportunities to upgrade herself.

My grandma started her career with what she knew:
🍼 Taking care of children
🧹 Cleaning physical spaces

When she started working at a government agency, her skillset limited her to sweeping roads under the hot sun.

As machines slowly took over her role, she upskilled herself with courses.

This helped her transition into a different role within the same agency:

Detecting mosquitoes in stagnant water.

My grandma couldn't read or write.

But she didn't let that get in the way of her education.

So, as a first-generation college student, I'm starting my third year of university in honor of her.

"I used to order lattes.

Then, ~2 years ago, my digestive system started rejecting it.

Mostly because of the milk used.


☕ But I HATE black coffee.

🌱 Plant-based milk was uncommon and expensive.


So, I stubbornly endured the toilet emergencies 🧻

...until someone showed me a diagram depicting different coffee drinks.


With my fingers crossed, I switched to a cappuccino.

Now I get to enjoy my coffee AND milk in peace.

"Tears were streaming down my face.

I was at a manifestation workshop last week.

Our guide asked us to pick a heavy emotion like guilt, shame, or grief.

Then, we each asked ourselves,
""What does this emotion feel like in my body?""

I picked guilt, because it was a recent emotion.

Immediately, my chest started constricting.
My nose felt pinched.
My eyes got watery.

As instructed, I sat with the discomfort.
Let myself feel everything.
Then thanked my body for showing me.


🤯 Interestingly, I felt refreshed afterwards.

Our default response to heavy emotions is to suppress them.

Or numb ourselves to the pain, sometimes with alcohol or other substances.


Over time, we either become numb to everything and feel ""lost""...

or the feelings pop back up, causing chaos.


Your feelings are whispers from your body.

Sit with them. Let yourself feel.

Then thank them for showing you what you need to know, and let them go.

"My heart stopped when I saw this screenshot in Slack.

""There's an error in the code, but it's not something I can edit,"" a student had reported.

As the Lead Curriculum Developer intern this year, I was supposed to ensure a smooth assessment week for everyone—

—such as catching errors like this during code review.

Here's what I would do in the future when things ""slip through the cracks"":

🎚️ 1) Assess the situation and employ damage control.

I had two options:
1) Correct the error, but cause disruption to students' work
2) Ignore the error and inform everyone that the question will be manually graded

When this error occurred, it was already halfway through assessment week.

Very likely, most students have already started on their submissions.

In this context, to minimize damage to the students' assessment experience, I went with Option 2.


☑️ 2) Prevent the mistake from happening again

I won't be in this role next year, so for the next Lead intern to avoid my mistakes, I'm:
📝 Listing out the subtasks involved in various processes
⏱️ Organizing these processes and tasks into suggested timelines
✅ Crafting checklists of what to look out for during reviews

Of course, no system is 100% foolproof.

But that's a chance for next year's Lead to
📝 Document their solutions to novel situations
📈 Improve the system for the next Lead

So, the next time accidents happen:
👉🏻 Identify what damage you want to minimize and act on it.
👉🏻 Systematize, document, and checklist your processes.
👉🏻 Make good use of your systems and tools!

"Yesterday, I had the privilege of sending off the Taiwanese delegation competing in the WorldSkills International Competition. The one thing I learned from them that I'll be applying to my work as a developer:

Take care of the details to remove friction.

The organizing team gave every member of the delegation a bright orange luggage strap branded with the WorldSkills Chinese Taipei logo. The straps help everyone quickly identify and pick up each other's baggage, hastening the entire baggage pickup process.

Everyone also received a blue ziplock bag containing travel necessities: two socket adapters, SIM cards, etc. For competitors, that means they can focus more on preparing for the competition instead of worrying about how to obtain these necessities if they had forgotten to pack them.

The details to take care of as a developer can be tiny: whether you have a second monitor to see your code and its output simultaneously, the code formatter you choose to use, or even the color theme of your code editor to minimize eye fatigue. However, optimizing them to make your work frictionless sometimes makes all the difference.

What is one detail you take care of in your work, and how does it help you?

1. Learning of information
2. Learning from lived experiences


The first one is easily done by AI.

"After living in 4 countries in the past 2 years for university...

I realized I was ""hugging the x-axis"" 👇🏼


When you ""hug the x-axis"", you're usually afraid of:
- Defining yourself by a single identity
- Being tied to a single place
- Commitment in general

💡 As a result, you might jump from idea to idea...
🌎 or country to country...
👩🏻‍🏫 or career to career...
... without a lot of ""results"" to show for it.


⚠️ There's nothing wrong with experimentation and exploration.
They help you figure out what you like and don't like.

Personally, living in so many countries has helped me think about:
✅ the people, culture and vibes
✅ the infrastructure
✅ the climate
of the place I want to call home in future.

But ultimately, if you want your efforts to compound:

Be intentional about your experimentations,
pick a handful of endeavors,
and just commit.

I first learned about this concept from David Perell.
